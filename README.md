# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Flash Chat application using flutter

I have created flutter application for group chat using flutter and firebase.

I have shared four different screens with screen shots.

## 1.Welcome screen
This screen provides options of log-in / sign-in for users.

## 2.Login screen
This screen allows user to login through firebase authentication.
Sign in screen is same as login screen.

## 3.Main chat screen
The chats with other users is in screen named "main_chat_screen".
This main_chat_screen is static UI design which means most of the screen doesn't have functionality, only group chat can work.
That screen is only for designing purpose.

## 4.Chat screen
This is where actual chat is happening.
